### Cocktail Collector is a website where users can add and share cocktail recipes.

Cocktail collector is a recipe website where users, mostly cocktail fans, can search for and post their favourite recipes, it has a recipe page where all users recipes can be viewed, it has a menber login function with ability to edit and delete recipes, and also an email sign up in the footer of the page so that users can recieve news updates.

## UX

### This website is for:

* Visitors to the website are looking for a resource to explore their interest in making cocktails, they are looking for recipes they perhaps have not heard of, and also a place to store the recipes that are their favourites.
* Hosting this website at the base level offers a service to fellow cocktail enthusiasts. It also has revenue stream possibilities once the number of users grows, this could be through advertising, but the sale of cocktail making products is also a possibility, this could be glasses, shakers etc.

### User Stories

* As a visitor to this website, I would like a catalogue of recipes to browse through.

## Design 

* Colors - The entire site is rendered in black and white(apart from flash messages, which are a light blue), This was a deliberate design choice, I thought that the subject matter of the site, the cocktails, were quite colourful and vibrant themselves, which made them the main focus of the page, any other color elements would only serve to distract. 

* Font - The font I have used for the site is [Roboto Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Mono), this font covers all text elements, I selected this font because of its typewriter like text appearance, I think this gives the site that kind of 'old world' apperence which is often associated with cocktails.

* Icons - The icons used in this project are taken from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/), I used font awesome for its diverse range of icons.

### Wireframes 



## Features

* The navagation bar and footer with sign up and social links extend across all pages.

### Home Page

* The home page features an almost full screen 'hero image' which gives visitors a good idea what the site is about.
* Under the image appears a welcome message and buttons, which let the visitor go straight to the recipe page, or register to become a member of the site.

### Recipes Page

* A gallery type section is the focus of this page, which show picture cards of cocktails which have been added to the site.
* Above this image gallery is a search bar where users can search for cocktails by name or ingredient.

### Register, Login and Logout

* A small form card is at the center of these pages, here users can either register using a username and password, or login using a previously registered username and password.
* The logout option does not have its own page, but redirects to the login page.

### Profile

* This is where uers are directed once they login to the site, and their registered username will appear at the top of the page.

### Manage Catagories

* This page is only accessible to the 'admin' of the site, here categories of cocktails, e.g. vodka, brandy etc. can be added, edited and deleted.

### Features left to implement

* Allowing users to 'favourite' other users recipes, and have them appear on their own profile page.
* Adding a comments section where users can leave reviews and tips for the cocktails.
* Add a rating system to the recipe cards, to show how popular they are.
